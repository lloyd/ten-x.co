		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>ten|x was founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pfinette">Pascal Finette</a>, a German-born serial entrepreneur with more than 20 years of experience at the intersection of entrepreneurship and technology. Our team has worked with Internet powerhouses such as Google, eBay and Mozilla; as well as innovative startups and governments around the world.</p>
		<p>Our expertise is anchored in cross-disciplinary experience, our deep understanding of technology and its impact on society and organizations. We apply entrepreneurial and design thinking to all aspects of our work, be it building technology accelerators to creating and implementing open innovation practices within global corporations.</p>
		<p>Today, we are seeing new technologies leading to exponential, not linear, growth. We are in the midst of a transition away from Moore's Law (which predicts a doubling in CPU power every two years) to trends of accelerated development and adoption. ten|x is uniquely positioned to make sense of these trends and explore the opportunities which arise out of this sea change in technology.</p>
		<blockquote>"The rate of innovation is a function of the number of people connected and exchanging ideas."<cite>Peter Diamandis</cite></blockquote>
