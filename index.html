		<h4>ten|x is a boutique consulting & interim management firm specialized in open innovation and entrepreneurship.</h4>
		<p>In the tradition of the great Silicon Valley companies we see ourselves as a garage. We don't hypothesize - we experiment, try stuff out, get our hands dirty and build things. The entrepreneurial process is deeply ingrained in us, we have unique experiences in building open innovation systems, creating technologies used by hundreds of millions of people around the globe and can bring Silicon Valley-thinking to companies all around the world. We aim to make things better - by 10x, not 10%.</p>
